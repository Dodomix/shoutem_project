### Development

To start the app, first run `npm install` in the root directory and in the `client`, `content-editor`, `style-editor` 
and `malicious-app` directories. Then, you can start all apps by running `yarn dev`. This will start two node servers 
(one for the main app and one for the minor iframe apps), the main app and the iframe apps. Ports 3000-3003 will be 
taken with the main app running on `localhost:3000`.
